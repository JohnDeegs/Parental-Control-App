CHANGES LIST:

12/10/2015:

- So far have added a sliding navbar using JS/Jquery. Undecided as to if to keep it. Experimenting with other designs for now.

- V2 has no longer a sliding navbar, it is fixed in position already.

- V2 contains a Log In made using HTML/CSS/JS. If kept, ready to add PHP for future DB interaction.

- Font is now Open Sans, an open source Google font. Open to suggestions for change but I personally really enjoy the look of the font.

- Color scheme of Log in will probably change, I'm not sure on the green.

15/10/2015:

- Added "Parental Control App" header to the index page. I imported the "Lobster" font from google fonts. I like the look of it, I'll see what it looks like once I've looked at potential logos over the weekend.
